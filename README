Get Blackberry OTA Installation

This is a simple script to retreive all files for an OTA install using a *.jad file.  It
will create the necessary *.alx file used by the Blackberry Desktop Manager Application.

This script is tested on OSX with the MacPorts version of wget installed.

Disclaimer
==========
It is by no means perfect.  Use at your own risk!  If you brick your blackberry, you've
only got the interweb to help you - there's plenty of sites for this.

Known Issues
============
* There's currently no input checking.
* Binary wget install on Mac OSX doesn't accept the --no-check-certificates wget option.
* Doesn't always create the ALX file correctly.
	If your apploader hangs, then most likely the ALX file is borked.  You can try
	manually editing it.
* Hard coded Blackberry 8800 User-Agent for now
